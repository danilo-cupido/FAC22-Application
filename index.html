                Hello everyone! My name is Danilo (he/him) and this is my story!
              </p>
              <p>
                I was born in Italy and lived most of my life in a beautiful
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genzano_di_Roma"

                >
                by the lake. I’ve always been a daydreamer and growing up I’ve
                become an idealist and activist.
              </p>
              <p>
                I got my bachelor degree in Development Studies with the hope to
                find my way in some Non-governmental organisations or Charities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because of my total lack of knowledge of the English language I
                planned to move to London and stay for (what it was meant to be)
                a short period of time in order to learn the language. There I
                worked as a barista until I lost my job due to the recent
                pandemic.
              </p>
              <p>
                During these years I’ve learnt how valuable is to live in a
                multicultural society and I made some very good friends from
                every corner of the globe. And I’ve found the Love of my life!

              My first contact with coding happened in the middle of the
              eighties when I was a child and
              <a href="Images/Enzo_and_Danilo.JPG" target="_blank"

              used to write some programmes in

              and run them on
              <a

                target="_blank"
                >Commodore 64</a
              >. During the high school I had the opportunity to learn
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal"
                target="_blank"
                >Turbo Pascal</a
              >
              but by the time of the Uni I was lost in Politics and Social
              Activism so I put my passion for coding aside until a few months
              ago.
            </p>

            <p>
              Talking with my partner, who is a developer, I told about the
              passion I once had for coding and that now I regret that I didn’t
              follow that path. They invited me to watch some video tutorials
              and try freeCodeCamp.
            </p>
            <p>
              I followed their advice and... BOOM!! I was caught and I just
              can't get enough! I believe that coding is a very powerful tool
              and if used in the right way can make a huge difference in
              people's everyday life. I also find coding as a pure form of
              expression, with almost no boundaries or limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here we are now! I'm dreaming to be a developer! Please don't wake
              me up!!

          </h2>
          <div class="text-container">
            <p>
              I've come across Founders and Coders thanks to my partner, who
              took part on FAC Cohort 20. They told me how functional is the
              peer-led learning system.
            </p>

            <p>
              The values of cooperation, inclusion and social impact at the core
              of Founders and Coders are one the main reasons behind my decision
              to apply to the next cohort. I've struggled most of my life to
              find a way to include my personal values and my academic studies
              into a potential career.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a white man I'm conscious to have privileges that are denied to
              other groups of people and I appreciate that FAC wants to help,
              and wants us to help, to change this. I find the guide on
              <a href="https://guidetoallyship.com/" target="_blank"
                >how to be a good ally</a
              >
              a remarkable tool!

            <p>
              Being part of the Discord community, attending the coaching
              sessions and the meetups, working on the daily challenges have
              boost my interest and willing to be a member of the next cohort.
              I've learned and improved so much and I would love to continue
              this growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              As well as the opportunity to be a mentor for the future cohorts
              and have the chance to give back and help others in their learning
              is something that makes me think that this is the right place for
              me.
